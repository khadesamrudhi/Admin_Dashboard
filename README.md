# Admin Dashboard

This **Admin Dashboard** is a frontend web application designed to help administrators efficiently manage users, roles, and permissions. It provides an easy-to-use interface for performing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations and features mock API data for quick integration and testing.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components with a utility-first approach.
- **Mock API**: Simulated data for user management, allowing seamless integration without backend setup.
- **JavaScript**: The core language for building the interactive frontend.
- **React Hooks**: For state and lifecycle management.

## Key Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, read, update, and delete user data through a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Search Bar**: Improve usability with a search bar to quickly filter and access user information.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Mock API Integration**: Realistic simulation of API calls to handle data, ensuring the app behaves as it would with real backend services.

## Bonus Features
- **Search Bar**: Added functionality to search users efficiently by name, email, or role.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented intuitive forms and controls for adding, editing, and deleting user information seamlessly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.

You donâ€™t have to use eject unless necessary. The default configuration is well-suited for most small-to-medium deployments.
